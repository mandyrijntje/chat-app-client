# :mega: Mock Chat App :mega: (Client)

A very wonderful application that lets people chat online with each other. Through this app I want to show my technical progress in creating a full-stack chat application while maintaining a sense of humour for a change in the commit messages while making some not so great decisions but eventually making it work.
